Conference paper: HUMAN DETECTION USING THERMAL ARRAY SENSOR AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING

Occupancy detection and people counting are increasingly important capabilities for smart solutions. For this purpose, in our research we use a thermal sensor array placed on the ceiling of an office. To determine the number of people present, we use a threshold based hierarchical clustering method, which makes successful detection very reliable under normal conditions.

You can find measurement dataset in csv format in the compressed file "Melexis_measurement_20220328.zip".

The algorithm of the paper is available in "GRADUS_persons_counting_algorithm.ipynb". It is a Google Colan notebook, some of the results can be generated only with the measueremnt input file (Melexis_measurement_20220328.csv) present in Colab system.
