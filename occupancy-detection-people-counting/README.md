Conference paper: HUMAN DETECTION USING THERMAL ARRAY SENSOR AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING

Occupancy detection and people counting are increasingly important capabilities for smart solutions. For this purpose, in our research we use a thermal sensor array placed on the ceiling of an office. To determine the number of people present, we use a threshold based hierarchical clustering method, which makes successful detection very reliable under normal conditions.
